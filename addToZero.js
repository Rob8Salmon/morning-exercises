// Starting array
let array = [28, 43, -12, 30, 4, 0, 12]

// create a var called "value", and set it to False
let value = "False"

// Write your solution below:

// create a loop that sets our first number to be compared, starting with index 0, then 1, then 2, etc...
for ()

// create an inner loop that sets our second number to be compared, starting with index 0

// if the outer loop and inner loop have matching iterators (they are looking at the same index in the array), don't do anything

// if the sum of our first number to be compared our second number to be compared === 0, change the value of my "value" variable to be false

// outside all loops, console.log the value
